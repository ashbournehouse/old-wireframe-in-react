# Andy's Getting Started with React and Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Purpose

The idea was to get some practice with React.createElement by recreating
an old wirefrme from may years ago.

I have stuck to 'plain valilla' React and steered clear of JSX while I
beat the workings of React.createElement into my brain.

### Who Knew ...

You could assign a button action directly in the 'props' parameter!! That might
have taken me a while to find in JSX.

### Warning ...

My naming convetions are probably all over the place ... I'll go back and tidy
them up soon.

### Warning TWO ...

I haven't made any effort to make this work, sensibly, on different sizes, aspect
ratios and resolution of displays. That's not the 'learning objective' at the moment
